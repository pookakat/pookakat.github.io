            <p class="paragraph">I am a former customer service representative with decades of experience, encompassing inbound and outbound customer 
                service, technical support, billing, and employee benefit support, as well as face-to-face billing support. I have 
                also served in a supervisory capacity for a team of twenty representatives through Apple's iPhone technical support 
                center.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The dedication to quality and proper communication, honed in my roles in customer service translated well into a 
                position as a Test Automation Engineer at Scripps Networks. My ability to communicate to a vast array of people,
                from senior developers to product owners gave me a firm foundation towards testing new applications for Scripps' 
                various web sites and advertising campaigns. I also assisted in migrating all content from the in-house CMS to a 
                more modern and easy to develop AWS environment.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">It was at Scripps that I found my true love towards web development. After completing my contract, my husband and 
                I moved back to the Raleigh-Durham area, and the search to return to a more technical role began. Soon, we found
                our way to UNC's Coding Bootcamp, and my journey to become a developer truly began.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Detail driven, team-oriented, with a growth mindset, I went to UNC's Coding Bootcamp to hone my skills further 
                develop my knowledge to become Super Developer, defender of semantics and champion of proper grammar.
